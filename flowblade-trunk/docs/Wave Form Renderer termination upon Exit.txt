Flowblade patch
===============

Author: Steven van de Beek, Sep-2018

Patch purpose:
Stopping the audio wave form renderer thread when exiting the application.

Explanation:
When a clip is added to a bin, a background process is launched to start an audio
wave form render. If the clip is long, this could take a long time and if you try
to leave the application before it is finished you will see the application keeps
on running. This is especially a problem when running it from the command line as
you don't get control over the command line back.
It will also still consume computer resources, which is not ideal.

Patch:
audiowaveformrenderer.py
-- Add self. to the process attribute in AudioRenderLaunchThread to make it accessible

app.py
-- When exiting the application, add a thread enumeration and try/except to terminate
   the threads that have a 'process' attribute, as these are started by
   audiowaveformrenderer.
